## Problem Definition
- What is the problem or challenge you're trying to address?
- What are the key business questions or goals?
- Define any hypotheses you are testing.

## Data Collection
- **Dataset Overview**: Describe the source and nature of the data (e.g., data from a public API, company database, Kaggle dataset).
- **Data Description**: Briefly describe the variables in the dataset (e.g., columns, types of data, etc.).
- **Data Source(s)**: Mention where the data comes from (e.g., Kaggle, API, company's internal database).

Example:
- **Source**: Kaggle's "Retail Sales Data"
- **Features**: Date, Store ID, Sales, Promotions, Location, etc.

## Data Exploration
- **Initial Exploration**: Summarize the initial exploration of the data (e.g., size, shape, and basic statistics).
- **Data Visualization**: Include relevant visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, correlation matrices) to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
  
Example:
- Number of rows and columns.
- Basic summary statistics (mean, median, mode).
- Distribution of sales by location.

## Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing data (e.g., imputation, removal).
- **Outliers**: Identify and handle outliers (e.g., capping, removing).
- **Data Transformation**: Any transformations applied (e.g., normalization, encoding categorical variables).

## Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provide detailed insights into the data (e.g., trends, correlations, patterns).
- **Statistical Tests**: Any tests or hypothesis testing conducted (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests).
- **Feature Engineering**: Describe any new features created for modeling.

## Modeling (if applicable)
- **Model Selection**: Describe the models you chose (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).
- **Modeling Process**: Discuss how you split the data (train/test), parameter tuning, and evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, F1 score).
- **Model Results**: Present the results from the models, such as performance metrics and any visualizations like ROC curves or confusion matrices.

## Results and Insights
- **Key Findings**: Summarize the insights you gained from the analysis and modeling.
- **Business Implications**: Discuss the practical implications of your findings (e.g., how the results can be used to improve decision-making or strategy).
- **Visualizations**: Include charts or graphs to support your insights (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts).

## Conclusion
- **Summary**: Provide a summary of the main findings and their importance.
- **Limitations**: Mention any limitations or challenges encountered during the analysis.
- **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations based on your analysis (e.g., further analysis, strategy changes).

## Future Work
- **Improvement Areas**: Discuss any ways the analysis could be expanded or improved in future work.
- **Next Steps**: Suggest potential next steps or further research areas (e.g., deploying a predictive model, integrating more data sources).
